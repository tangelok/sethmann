            <h1>A Place to Call Home</h1>
            <p>Since 1921, the Seth Mann 2nd Home for Women has offered a unique alternative for women 62 and older who want to live independently, but need some assistance to do so.
            <p>Our goal is to help every woman be as active and involved as she wants or is able to be. Planned activites are available to help residents stay socially connected.</p>
            <p>The home has accommodations for five women; our dedicated caregivers assist each resident to ensure her emotional and physical needs are met. </p>
            <p>We pride ourselves on the personal touches that make our home the next best thing to the resident's home.</p>
