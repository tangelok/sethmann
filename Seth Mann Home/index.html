            <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
            <p>Since 1921, the Seth Mann 2nd Home for Women has offered a unique alternative for women aged 62 and older who want to maintain an independent lifestyle, but need some assistance to do so. Our home offers long-term, short-term and respite care that is always provided with compassion and sensitivity.</p>
            <p>The Seth Mann Home has accommodations for five women whose needs can be met in a residential care facility. Our dedicated caregivers assist each resident to ensure her social, emotional and physical needs are met. We maintain a home-like atmosphere while offering 24-hour care and amenities that are customized to each woman's schedule. </p>
            <p>Our goal is to help every woman be as active and involved as she wants or is able to be. Our location is convenient to houses of worship, stores, restaurants and public transportation; residents are also able to keep their own cars if desired.</p>
